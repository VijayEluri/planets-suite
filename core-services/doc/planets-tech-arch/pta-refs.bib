  abstract = {The preservation of digital objects requires specific software tools
	or services. These can be characterisation tools that abstract the
	essential characteristics of a digital object from a file, migration
	tools that convert digital objects to different formats, or emulation
	tools that render digital objects in their original context on a
	new infrastructure. Until recently digital preservation has been
	characterised by practices and processes that could best be described
	as more art and craft than science. The Planets Testbed provides
	a controlled environment where preservation tools can be tested and
	evaluated, and where experiment results can be empirically compared.
	This paper presents an overview of the Testbed application, an analysis
	of the experiment methodology and a description of the Testbed's
	web service approach.},

	have considerably shortened the lifespan of digital objects. Digital
	preservation has become a pressing challenge. Different strategies
	such as migration and emulation have been proposed; however, the
	decision for a specific tool e.g. for format migration or an emulator
	is very complex. The process of evaluating potential solutions against

	manual, sometimes ad-hoc process with little or no tool support.
	This paper presents a service-oriented architecture and decision
	support tool that implements a solid preservation planning process
	and integrates services for content characterisation, preservation
	action and automatic object comparison to provide maximum support
	for preservation planning endeavours.},

	eXtensible Characterisation Languages},

  year = {2008},
  volume = {14},
  pages = {2936--2952},

  abstract = {During the last decades, digital objects have become the primary medium
	to create, shape, and exchange information. However, in contrast
	to analog objects such as books that directly represent their content,
	digital objects are not usable without a corresponding technical
	environment. The fast changes in these environments and in formats
	and technologies mean that digital documents have a short lifespan
	before they become obsolete. Digital preservation, i.e. actions to
	ensure longevity of digital information, thus has become a pressing
	challenge. The dominant strategies prevailing today are migration
	and emulation; for each strategy, different tools are available.
	When converting an object to a different representation, a validation
	of the content is needed to verify that the transformed objects are
	still authentically representing the same intellectual content. This
	validation so far is largely done manually, which is infeasible for
	large collections.
	
	
	Preservation planning supports decision makers in reaching accountable
	decisions by evaluating potential strategies against well-defined
	requirements. Especially the evaluation of different migration tools
	for digital preservation has to rely on validating the converted
	objects and thus on an analysis of the logical structure and the
	content of documents. Existing approaches for characterising and
	describing objects do not attempt to fully extract the informational
	content of digital objects and thus are not suffficient for an in-depth
	validation of transformed content. 
	
	This paper describes the eXtensible Characterisation Languages (XCL)
	that support the automatic validation of document conversions and
	the evaluation of migration quality by hierarchically decomposing
	a document and representing documents from different sources in an
	abstract XML language. The description language XCDL provides an
	abstract representation of digital content in XML, while the extraction
	language XCEL allows an extraction engine to create such an abstract
	description by mapping file format structures to XCDL concepts. 
	
	We present the context of the development of these languages and tools
	and describe the overall concept and features of the languages. We
	further give examples and show how the languages can be applied to
	the evaluation of digital preservation solutions in the context of
	preservation planning.},

	metadata, and archival descriptive information in one archival information
	package, independent of any specific software and hardware, based
	upon plain text files and the standardized languages SQL and XML.
	For usage purposes, a SIARD archive can be reloaded into any current
	or future RDBMS which supports standard SQL. In addition, SIARD contains
	a client that enables 'on demand' reload of archives into a target
	RDBMS, and multi-user remote access for querying and browsing the
