= Planets Interoperability Framework API Overview =

This document describes the API of the Planets Interoperability Framework (IF). The purpose of this document is to provide a high-level introductory overview of the API. For detailed documentation consult the Javadoc API documentation and the unit tests, both included in the Planets Services (PSERV) project (see http://gforge.planets-project.eu/gf/project/pserv).

== Overview ==

The Planets Interoperability Framework (IF) has three levels of access: UI, web service API and actual native Java API (see Fig. 1 below).

This document is organized around two central aspects of the Planets IF API: services and data. In each of these sections, related concepts and API elements are covered, in particular the central interfaces and data types, the service registry, the data registry and the format registry. 

= Services =

The Planets IF takes a Java-first approach to web services. This means the WSDL is generated from Java Interfaces containing web service annotations. Therefore, Planets can be seen as a plain Java library for preservation systems or services development.

== Service Interfaces ==

The different kinds of Planets services are defined as Java interfaces. Each preservation action verb has a corresponding Java interface, e.g. 
 
  Migrate, Validate, Identify, Characterise, Compare, Modify
 
Additionally, there are some specialized versions of these interfaces and some additional, less common interfaces (see the <code>eu.planets_project.services package</code>).

A service implementation written in Java implements the desired interface and defines itself as a web service using the <code>@WebService</code> annotation with an <code>endpointInterface</code> attribute. This allows the service to reuse all web service specific settings from the interfaces, without declaring them itself. 

For Java clients, using JAX-WS (see https://jax-ws.dev.java.net/) enables usage of the web service without interfering with SOAP or a WSDL directly, using a proxy object that appears to the client as a normal object implementing the given interface (Migrate, Validate, etc.). 

A non-Java client can generate stubs from the WSDL that is generated from the service by JAX-WS in the way specified in the interfaces. This way, Planets services can be accessed in a language-independent way. Fig. 2 provides an overview of the Planets IF services API.

== Service Responses ==

All Planets interfaces define a method corresponding to the verb they implement (e.g. migrate, validate, identify), which returns a result, whose type is determined by the verb (e.g. MigrateResult, ValidateResult, IdentifyResult). 

Result types are typically made of the verb-specific result (e.g. a digital object for migration, a format for identification, etc.) and a general service report. A service report consists of a type (info, error, warn), a status (success, installation error, tool error) and a message:

  ServiceReport report = new ServiceReport(Type.INFO, Status.SUCCESS, message);
  
== Service Implementation ==

The following sections provide an overview both on implementing Planets services (''being Planets services'') and calling Planets service implementations (''using Planets services'').

=== Being Planets services ===

To make your functionality usable as Planets services (and have them registered in a Planets service registry) the best way to go is to have your class implement the most suitable Planets preservation verb interface (e.g. Migrate, Validate, Identify, Characterise, Modify, ...). This will not only allow your services to be registered in a Planets service registry (see Fig. 3 below), but will also allow preservation workflows querying the service registry (e.g. for a migration service) to discover your service.

</center> 

If implementing one of the preservation verb interfaces is not feasible or automatic support for discovery by workflows is not required, a service could also directly implement the <code>PlanetsService</code> interface. This allows the service to be stored in a Planets service registry. It can be queried based on all the properties set in the service description, but will not automatically be interoperable on a workflow level with Planets services (see Fig. 3 above). 

Planets services are only registered indirectly in a service registry, using a <code>ServiceDescription</code> object (see Fig. 3 above and details in the following section). These objects can be serialized to XML. To register a non-Java service in a Planets service registry, an XML representation conforming to the Planets service description schema can be generated and stored in a Planets service registry.

=== Using Planets services ===

As described above, Planets services are basically just classes implementing certain Java interfaces. 

If you want to access Planets functionality on the Java platform without working in a web service environment, Planets can be seen as a normal Java API, i.e. you can just instantiate classes, e.g:

 Migrate jtidy = new JTidy();

See the API documentation for further details on this.

If you want to access remote Planets web services from Java, you can use JAX-WS to hide the SOAP layer and retrieve a proxy object from a server that will conform to the interface (i.e. you will work with an instance of a class that implements the interface, e.g. <code>Migrate</code>).

 URL wsdl = new URL("http://127.0.0.1:8080/pserv-pa-jtidy/JTidy?wsdl");
 Migrate jtidy = ServiceUtils.createService(Migrate.QNAME, Migrate.class, wsdl);

To access Planets services from non-Java platforms, you can either generate stubs from the WSDL exposed for the service or directly create SOAP messages conforming to the web service schemas (for service descriptions, digital objects, etc).

== Service Descriptions ==

Each interface described above extends the <code>PlanetsService</code> interface, which defines a <code>describe()</code> method. This method returns a service description containing service metadata like input format, tool name and version, service provider, etc. The XML representations of  these service descriptions are used to register and look up services in the Planets service registry (cf. Fig. 4). 

A flexible ''query by example'' mechanism (cf. next section) allows for service lookup based on various service attributes (see Fig. 4 for all available service description attributes).

</center>

== Service Registry ==

The Planets service registry enables users and service providers to look up, publish and manage information about Planets services. This information can be used to dynamically select and invoke simple services, as well as to reuse them as part of choreographed complex workflows. 

The service registry code is available from the Planets Services (PSERV) project (see http://gforge.planets-project.eu/gf/project/pserv) (in IF/servreg). The service registry can be accessed from the IF administration interface and as a Java or SOAP-based web service API.

=== Java API ===

Given a running and configured Planets Services (PSERV) project, the local service registry can be accessed via the <code>ServiceRegistryFactory</code> class:

  ServiceRegistry registry = ServiceRegistryFactory.getServiceRegistry();

To connect to a remote service registry, supply the location of the WSDL to the factory method.

Using the service registry instance, <code>ServiceDescription</code> objects can be registered and the registry can be queried. Queries are submitted using a ''query by example'' mechanism: a <code>ServiceDescription</code> object describing the services to find is created and passed to the query method, e.g. to find identification services by name:

  registry.query(new ServiceDescription.Builder("DROID", Identify.class.getName()).build());
  
The given values of the service description can be matched using different modes: exact (default), wildcard, and regular expression matching, e.g. for finding services by name and using wildcard matching:

  registry.queryWithMode(
    new ServiceDescription.Builder("DROID*", Identify.class.getName()).build(), MatchingMode.WILDCARD);
  
Fig. 3 shows the structure of the <code>ServiceDescription</code> objects used as examples in the queries. Any combination of these attributes can be set in the query example, allowing flexible and customizable service queries (e.g. ''find migration services that can migrate PNF to TIFF based on the ImageMagick tool'').

The query methods of the service regisatry return a list of ServiceDescription objects. these service descriptions contain the information required to instantiate a service (in particular, the service endpoint). The IF offers convenience API to instantiate a service from a service description in a Java environment, e.g. for identification service from the sample above:

  Identify service = ServiceUtils.createService(serviceDescription);

See ''RemoteServiceCreationTests'' in the code repository for a complete example on using the service creation utility methods.

=== SOAP API ===

The mechanisms and API described above (''query by example'', optional matching mode) can be accessed via SOAP, passing the sample service description in its XML representation.
  
= Data =

== Digital Objects ==

The central noun involved in using the Planets IF API is the ''digital object''. A digital object represents a single byte stream involved in a preservation action (e.g. ''identify a digital object''). Fig. 5 provides an overview of the Planets IF digital object API.

=== Content Representation ===

To allow streaming of large files over web services, a digital object's content can be created in two conceptually different ways: ''by value'' (the content is actually embedded in the XML representation of the digital object and thus in the SOAP message, too) or ''by reference'' (the content will be streamed as an attachment to the SOAP message).

Embedded content by value can be cretaed from a byte array, a file, or an input stream:

  new DigitalObject.Builder(Content.byValue(bytes)).build();
  
Streamable content by reference can be created from a URL, a file, or an input stream:

  new DigitalObject.Builder(Content.byReference(url)).build();
  
In whatever way the content has been created, it can be read in a uniform way:

  InputStream stream = digitalObject.getContent().getInputStream();
  
When passed over web services, content by reference has the ability to be attached to the SOAP message and be streamed from the client to the server and vice versa, based on web service interoperability standards implemented by the METRO web service stack (see http://java.sun.com/webservices/). This avoids storing the entire digital object in the RAM and therefore enables the transmission of digital objects that are larger than the available RAM on the client or server side.

=== Interfaces and Builders ===

The central entities of the Planets API (DigitalObject, ServiceDescription, etc.) are implemented as immutable classes, which are created using builders.

The usage of a builder can be seen in the example illustrating the content representation above: a minimal digital object consists of nothing but its content. If we want to set additional attributes of the digital object (e.g. a unique ID), these are set on the builder before the object is built:

  new DigitalObject.Builder(Content.byValue(bytes)).permanentUri(id).build();

By setting these attributes on the builder, the resulting digital object instance can be made immutable and as an immutable object be used and shared freely, even in concurrent computing setups. At the same time, combining an interface with a builder allows for the actual implementation class to be hidden behind the API (e.g. to be changed or swapped out after releasing the API). 

To allow third party implementations of Planets digital objects, the Planets <code>DigitalObject</code> is defined as an interface.

=== XML Serialization ===

To allow passing of digital objects via web services, a JAXB XML adapter defines a standard <code>DigitalObject</code> implementation (<code>ImmutableDigitalObject</code>) to be used. This implementation, however, is hidden from a normal Java API consumer and only exposed as a WSDL.

Besides supporting XML serialization for web service usage, digital objects can also be stored as XML directly via the API:

  String xml = digitalObject.toXml(); 

Given such an XML representation, the digital object instance can be instantiated directly via the API:
  
  DigitalObject object = new DigitalObject.Builder(xml).build();
  
The XML serialization schema of the digital object is described in Fig. 6 (digital object) and 7 (structure of the contained event properties).

== Data Registry ==

The data registry enables storage and retrieval of digital objects. The <code>DigitalObjectManager</code> interface can be implemented for different concrete storage solutions.

=== Java API ===

A data registry is instantiated using a DataRegistryFactory:

  DataRegistry registry = DataRegistryFactory.getDataRegistry();

As a client of the Planets Java API, the data registry can be used directly to store digital objects using an ID, represented as a URI:

  registry.store(uri, digitalObject);
  
Digital objects can be retrieved from the data registry using the given ID:

  DigitalObject digitalObject = registry.retrieve(uri); 

=== SOAP API ===

Like the service registry, the Planets data registry is also available as a SOAP-based web service, which uses the XML serialization mechanism of digital objects described above and allows language-independent access to a Planets data registry.

== Formats ==

Another central noun in the Planets IF API is the ''format'', e.g. to specify the format a digital object should be migrated to (e.g. ''migrate a digital object to PNG'') or the supposed format of a file to validate (e.g. ''validate that a digital object is a PNG''). 

Formats are represented as URIs in the Planets IF API. The URIs can specify a PRONOM ID (see http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/PRONOM/), a file extension, or a MIME type. Fig. 8 gives an overview of the Planets IF formats API.

== Format Registry ==

The format registry enables access to and creation of the various format URIs used in the Planets IF API. A registry instance can (as for the ServiceRegistry) be obtained from the corresponding factory (which again enables us to hide the actual registry implementation behind the API):

  FormatRegistry registry = FormatRegistryFactory.getFormatRegistry();
  
Given the registry, we can create format URIs for PRONOM IDs, MIME types or file extensions, e.g.:

  URI puid = registry.createPronomUri("fmt/13");
   
The format registry also provides ways to map the different format types (PRONOM, MIME, extension) onto each other, e.g.:

  Set<String> extensions = registry.getExtensions(puid);
