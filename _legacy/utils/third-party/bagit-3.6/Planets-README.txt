Installing BagIt in the Planets Maven Repository
------------------------------------------------

This project contains a slightly modified version of the BagIt POM. 
It just ensures any deployed artifacts will go to the Planets Sourceforge site.

To make this work, you need to download the source from, e.g.

http://sourceforge.net/projects/loc-xferutils/files/loc-bil-java-library/3.6/bagit-3.6-src.zip

and unpack the src directory to the current folder.  It should then build and install.
