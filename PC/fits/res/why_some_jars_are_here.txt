The adapter Jars found in this directory (*_adapter_*.jar) 
contain DTD files required for the NZ metadata extractor
(used by FITS) to work.

JBoss will only make these files available in the deployed WAR 
if they are contained in WEB-INF/classes (where files in the 
resources directory are copied by our Ant build system).

So basically, these Jar files are also config files and therefore
included here in the resources directory.
