- The XcdlAccess class processes an XCDL file and get the properties only.
- The XcdlParser class provides full access to the XCDL via JAXB-generated classes

The classes in generated/ have been generated from the XCDL XSD files (in the 
xcltools project), using a custom binding that creates better classes (custom.xjb), 
using the command:

./xjc.sh -extension -b custom.xjb -p eu.planets_project.xcdl.generated XCDLCore.xsd
