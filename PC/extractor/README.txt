HOW TO INSTALL THE EXTRACTOR TOOL:
----------------------------------

1) simply unzip the archive "Extractor_v0.2_win32.zip" to a location of your choice.

2) Now you have to set up an system-variable for your system, with the following name: "EXTRACTOR_HOME". 
This variable has to point to the folder where you have unzipped the archive to: 

	e.g., if you have unzipped the archive to 

	"C:\planets-tools\extractor\Extractor_v0.2_win32 

	then you have to set up the variable like this:

	"EXTRACTOR_HOME = C:\planets-tools\extractor\Extractor_v0.2_win32"

It is important that the variable points to the folder in which the "Extractor.exe" is located!

This system-variable is used by the Extractor services to locate the Extractor installfolder on your system.
