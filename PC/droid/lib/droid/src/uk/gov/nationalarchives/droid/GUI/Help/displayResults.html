<h2>Displaying results</h2>

<p>Once the file identification is complete, the <B>File list pane</B>
    shows the identification status of each file using the following icons:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><img src="positive.GIF" alt="Positive hit"></img>&nbsp; a positive identification has been made based on the
        binary signature of the file
    </li>
    <li><img src="tentitive.GIF" alt="Tentative hit"></img>&nbsp; a tentative identification has been made based on the
        file extension alone because no binary signature information was available for this file format
    </li>
    <li><img src="noHit.GIF" alt="No hit"></img>&nbsp; no hits were found for this file</li>
    <li><img src="error.GIF" alt="Error"></img>&nbsp; an error occurred while attempting to identify this file</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Selecting an identified file in the <B>File list pane</B>,
    brings up a list of identified file formats
    in the <B>Identification results pane</B>.
    Each file format is described by its <U>P</U>ronom <U>U</U>nique <U>ID</U>entifier (<B>PUID</B>),
    along with the name, version and MIME type of the format.
    Its identification status can be:
    <ul>
        <li><B>Positive (Specific)</B> if the file satisfies a binary signature which identifies a single file format
        </li>
        <li><B>Positive (Generic)</B> if the file satisfies a binary signature which identifies several file formats
        </li>
        <li><B>Tentative</B> if the file has a file extension used by the file format, and there are no available binary
            signatures for this file format
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    Selecting a file with an error status in the <B>File list pane</B>,
    brings up a description of the error
    in the <B>Identification results pane</B>.
