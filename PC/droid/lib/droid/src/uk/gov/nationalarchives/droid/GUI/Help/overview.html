<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The purpose of DROID is to identify file formats based on their binary signatures.
    It is designed to be used interactively through the graphical user interface,
    though it can also be run as a <a href="commandLineTool.html">command line tool</a>.
    The list of file format signature defintions is continously reviewed
    and updated by The National Archives, and can be downloaded by users of DROID.</p>

<p>The main DROID user interface is described below:</p>

<h3>File list pane</h3>

<p>
    All files that the tool can or has identified are listed here.
    If the file has been through the identification process an icon is
    displayed in the status column describing the result status. The options are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><img src="positive.GIF" alt="Positive hit"></img> a positive identification has been made based on the binary
        signature of the file
    </li>
    <li><img src="tentitive.GIF" alt="Tentative hit"></img> a tentative identification has been made based on the file
        extension alone because no binary signature information was available for this file format
    </li>
    <li><img src="noHit.GIF" alt="No hit"></img> no hits were found for this file</li>
    <li><img src="error.GIF" alt="Error"></img> an error occurred while attempting to identify this file</li>
</ul>
<h3>Identification results pane</h3>

<p>
    Whenever a file is selected in the File list pane, its identification results are displayed in this pane.
    This can be either a list of file formats identified or a description of the error if the file has an error status.
</p>

<h3>Progress bar</h3>

<p>
    Displays the progress when the file identification process is taking place.
