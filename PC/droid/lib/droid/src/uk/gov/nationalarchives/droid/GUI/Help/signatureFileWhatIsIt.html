<h2>What is the Pronom signature file</h2>

<p>The signature file is an XML file which can be <a href="signatureFileDownload.html">downloaded by DROID</a>
    from The National Archives' PRONOM website. It contains all the necessary
    information for DROID to identify file formats by means of
    binary signatures.</p>

<p>The signature file is managed by The National Archives who will, from time to time, add new file formats
    and new binary signatures. It is therefore important to regularly
    <a href="signatureFileDownload.html#checkForUpdates">check for signature file updates</a>.</p>
