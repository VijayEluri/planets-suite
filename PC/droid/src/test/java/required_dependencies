To run these tests, add the following IF dependencies to the project:
(Adding the entire IF as a project dependency causes problems)

- if_sp/appserver/lib/endorsed/*.jar
- if_sp/appserver/client/*.jar
- if_sp/appserver/server/default/lib/*.jar
- if_sp/appserver/server/default/deploy/jbossws.sar/*.jar

(These should be set if you use Eclipse with the .classpath file 
included in pserv project, where duplicate entries are removed)
