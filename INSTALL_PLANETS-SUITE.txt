Before installing the Planets-Suite software you should have already installed the
Planets-Server project, (see http://sourceforge.net/projects/planets-server).  This
sets up a customised JBOSS server, which is required to run the Planets Software Suite.

(1) checkout planets-server from the SourceForge:
svn checkout https://planets-server.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/planets-server/trunk planets-server

(3) modify (at least all required) properties in the planets-server.properties file

    - Set the root directory of the JBOSS install: if_server.dir
    - Set the planets config directory: if_server.conf
    - Set the planets data registry config directory: if_server.doms.config.dir
