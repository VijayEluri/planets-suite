ok so here is how we generated the measurementsDescriptor from the FPM files.

there is five fpm files, referenced in filelist.xml
we merged these using mergeFPMfiles.xslt into one, called fpmcomplete.xml

we then realised this needs a root element ;) so we added <formats> as a root element.

from this one, we generated all properties with their possible Metrics, right as we need it, 
using genMD.xslt. This file is perfect apart from the fact that it misses the <metrics> part at the end.
That was the tricky part - which is done by generateMetrics.xslt using Saxon, 
which results in generatedMetrics.xslt.

That part was just copied into the other, and that results in generatedMeasurementsXCL.xml -
which is copied over to the evlauationdescriptor directory data/evaluation.
Which is when we noted that we forgot the collection tag element <measurableProperties>, 
which we added by hand again ;)


SECOND RUN, 14.6.2010: we realise that we have redundant property declarations across property files,
which differ only in their format-specific descriptions.
For now we leave out these format-specific descriptions and use only the general ones.

So we need an updated genMD.xslt, or rather rename this to generateProperties.xslt
and include a filter for distinct IDs.

usage e.g.
java -jar saxon9he.jar -s:fpmcomplete.xml -xsl:C:\Users\cb\workspace\plato-clean\data\pp5\fpm\generateProperties.xslt -o:OUT.xml

so we have these properties-nometrics.xml that we can join in with the metrics to get a new generatedMeasurementsXCL.xml
