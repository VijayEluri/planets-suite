# Tooltip Text
new_exp.tooltipFormalInformal=Choose whether your experiment will be formal or informal.  A formal experiment will be added to the main experiments database for other users to see whereas an informal experiment will only be visible to you.  You need to supply more information for a formal experiment - note the fields marked with a red asterisk - but these experiments will be of more value in the long term.
new_exp.tooltipID=You can use this column if your institution wishes to assign an ID to their experiments.  Note that the Testbed will automatically generate a Testbed specific ID for each experiment so this column should only be used if you wish to tie your experiment to an external reference. 
new_exp.tooltipName=Enter a name for your experiment.  This should be a fairly short, descriptive title that is unique to your experiment.   The name you choose will be used to identify your experiment in the experiment search and browse pages.
new_exp.tooltipAdaptedFrom=The experiment listed here provided the structure for the current experiment. 
new_exp.tooltipIdeas=If your experiment was influenced by existing experiments you can add references to these experiments here.

new_exp.tooltipFocus=More detailed information on the experiment you will be undertaking, including descriptions of its specific aims and objectives.
new_exp.tooltipContactName=The name of the person other Testbed users should contact if they wish to know more about your experiment.  Your can replace your name with another if required.
new_exp.tooltipContactEmail=The e-mail address of the person other Testbed users should contact if they wish to know more about your experiment.  Your can replace your email address with another valid email address if required.
new_exp.tooltipContactTel=The telephone number of the person other Testbed users should contact if they wish to know more about your experiment.  Your can replace your telephone number with another if required.
new_exp.tooltipContactAddress=The address of the person other Testbed users should contact if they wish to know more about your experiment.  Your can replace your address with another if required.
new_exp.tooltipPurpose=Enter the purpose of your experiment.  You might want to include such details as why you are conducting the experiment, what you are hoping to prove by carrying it out and how this relates to the practices of your institution.
new_exp.tooltipFocus=More detailed information on the experiment you will be undertaking, including descriptions of its specific aims and objectives.
new_exp.tooltipRefs=If your experiment references any papers, books or web pages you can add references to them here.

new_exp.tooltipToolType=Select one or more tool types that your experiment will be using.  Select multiple types by holding down the 'Ctrl' key.  Note that the selection of tool types is solely to give an indication of the type of experiment you are designing; it does not affect options available during later stages in the experiment process.
new_exp.tooltipObjectType=Select one or more object types that your experiment will be using.  Select multiple types by holding down the 'Ctrl' key.  Note that the selection of object types is solely to give an indication of the type of experiment you are designing; it does not affect options available during later stages in the experiment process.
