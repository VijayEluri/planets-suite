* a simple characterisation service
**

The component provides a simple characterization EJB3 Web service.
It takes a local file reference as input and returns the mime type.

Note: This service is not compliant to the PLANETS service interface, which is restricted to one Web method per Web service. The service is implemented in Java and does not wrap any legacy tools.
