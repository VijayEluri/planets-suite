Draft Leve 2 Planets Service2
-----------------------------

These services make use of the data registry and the full Planets data model.  The former is not suited to a service-oriented 
architecture, as it requires third-party write access to user data.  The latter is institutionally dependent and cannot
be used to implement globally interoperable services at present.

These classes and services should probably become Planets Workflows.
